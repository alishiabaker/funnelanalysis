Funnel Analysis for a rideshare company
This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization. I used SQL to query the data and Tableau for data visualization to conduct a funnel analysis and address the business questions of the stakeholders. Through this I was able to uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel.
